# Weekly Reading Group on Offline RL at [GRAIL](https://grail.ift.ulaval.ca/)

**Organizer**: [Mathieu Godbout](mailto:mathieu.godbout.3@ulaval.ca)

## Structure

Everyone reads the weekly paper and a discussion guide is (pseudo-)randomly drawn at beginning of each of our meeting. 
The discussion guide should only drive the conversation and make sure we are able to cover the entirety of the paper within the scheduled hour.
Meetings are every Wednesdays from 3PM to 4PM (EST) and occur on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/cjz-kyhh-mox).

## Summer 2021

Only scheduled until July 14th for now.
The rest of the summer is TBD.
