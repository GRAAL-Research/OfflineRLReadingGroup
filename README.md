# Weekly Reading Group on Offline RL at [GRAIL](https://grail.ift.ulaval.ca/)

**Organizer**: [Mathieu Godbout](mailto:mathieu.godbout.3@ulaval.ca)

## Structure

Everyone reads the weekly paper and a discussion guide is (pseudo-)randomly drawn before each of our meeting. 
The discussion guide only has to prepare a few comments or questions and makes sure we are able to cover the entirety of the paper within the scheduled hour.
Meetings are every Wednesdays from 3PM to 4PM (EST) and occur on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/cjz-kyhh-mox).
